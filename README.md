# VEGETABLE_BILLING
This program functions as a digital checkout system structured through Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It begins by defining a Vegetable class, which serves as a blueprint for individual items, storing their ID, name, price per kilogram, and quantity, while also containing a method to calculate the subtotal for that specific item. These individual objects are then managed by a VegetableShop class, which acts as a virtual shopping cart; it uses an array to store multiple vegetable objects and features a billing method that iterates through the list to print a formatted receipt and calculate the final grand total.

The execution logic, handled in the main method, facilitates interaction between the user and the code. It first prompts the user to define the number of items to be processed to initialize the storage array. As the user inputs data for each vegetable, the program creates a new instance of the Vegetable class and adds it to the shop's inventory. To ensure the program runs correctly, specific adjustments were made to the Scanner input logic to prevent the "newline" bug—where the program skips the name input after reading a number—and the code was formatted to produce a clean, tabular bill that summarizes the entire transaction.
